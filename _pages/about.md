My advisor is **Professor Jonathan W. Siegel**, and my research focuses on the **theoretical analysis of machine learning methods** for scientific computing and systems engineering. More recently, I am focusing on the theoretical aspects of invariant neural network architectures, such as DeepSets, DeepOSets, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 

Before starting my PhD, I completed my B.S in Applied Mathematics at UCLA.

If you are interested in talking about anything machine learning theory related, or if you feel there is any possibility for collaboration on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at **aditnambiar at tamu dot edu**
